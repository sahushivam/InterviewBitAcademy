Database Sharding
	A process of splitting up a database across  multiple machines to improve the scalability of an application.

	Database ---> logical shards --->(distributed) physical shards

	Advantages of Sharding

	1. High Availability
	2. Faster queries responses (queries have to go over fewer rows)
	3. More write bandwidth: with no master database serializing writes you can write in parallel.

	4. Scaling out

	Disadvantage of sharding

	1. Add complexity in the system
	2. Rebalancing data
