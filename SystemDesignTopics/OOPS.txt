Object-oriented programming is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic.

Why OOPS-
	Allows inheritance, reducing development time, easier development experience, and more accurate coding and robustness with reusability. Also data hiding prevents instance of certain class from accidentally accessing other data - safe development. The encapsulation allows programmer to define the class with many functions and characteristics and only few functions are exposed to the user.

four OOPS principle
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism

Association
An association is used when one object wants another object to perform a service for it
	
	Aggregation
		has-a relationship
		Teacher belongs to department. The teacher will not be destroyed if department is destroyed

	Composition
		is-a relationship
		Inheritance
		House has many rooms


Coupling
	A measure of how closely connected software modules are. Loosely coupled system comprises of components that have little or no knowledge of other separate components.

Cohesion
	A measure of the strength of relationship between the classâ€™ methods and data. High cohesion is associated with reusability, understandability, and robustness.
