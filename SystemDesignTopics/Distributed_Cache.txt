Cashing best practice
	Validity
	High hit rate
	TTL in cache

Feature Estimation
	Terabytes of data
	1 M QPS
	1 ms latency
	100% availability

Cache access patterns
	Write through
	Write around          / cache
					write 
						  \ db
	Write back

Most simple data structure for cache is hashmap
	
We can go for consistent hashing for distributed cache.
