SQL offers ACID
NoSql offers Base (Eventual Consistency)
	BASE stands for BA (Basic Availability), S (Soft-State) and E (Eventual Consistency).

	Soft-State ( S ) : Stores don’t have to write consistent. No different replicas have to be mutually consistent all the time.


1. RDBMS can not handle ‘Data Variety’.
2. Difficult to change tables and relationships.
3. Joins takes time

In NoSQL each point of application can be stored as single document.

CA--- Relational Database
AP--- Cassandra, DynamoDB (Wide-Column Store/Key Value Pair)
CP--- HBase,Hive,Giraph 

Start with SQL db
	well worn technologies, docs, books, communities
	well known paths to scalability
	would work well for a lot of data

NoSQL comes in place if:
	working with terabytes of data
	no clear need for JOINS (relational)
	super low latency is required
	very well suited to distributed data
	
	if schema changes need take use nosql is good
