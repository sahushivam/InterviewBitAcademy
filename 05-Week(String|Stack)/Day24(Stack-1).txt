1- Largest Area in Histogram
2- Largest Rectangle of all ones in matrix of 0/1
3- Min Stack
	we never store minimum element in stack, if element is less than stack top then we insert 2*x- min_element

	in pop if we see that min_element> stack.top(), then we change min_element = 2*min_element - st.top()
