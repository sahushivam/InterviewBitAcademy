K-th character of decrypted string
	Given a String A and an integer B. String A is encoded consisting of lowercase 
	English letters and numbers. A is encoded in a way where repetitions of substrings
	are represented as substring followed by the count of substrings. For example: if 
	the encrypted string is “ab2cd2” and B=4, so the output will be ‘b’ because the
	decrypted string is “ababcdcd” and 4th character is ‘b’. You have to find and
	 return the Bth character in the decrypted string. Note: Frequency of encrypted 
	 substring can be of more than one digit. For example, in “ab12c3”, ab is repeated 
	 12 times. No leading 0 is present in the frequency of substring.

Check if expressions are the same.
