Multiprocessing- Multiple process
Multiprogramming - When a process goes for IO, new process is loaded
Multithreading - Running multiple process using CPU scheduling algo

Paging
Virtual Memory- Used when process size is more than RAM allocated to it, so secondary memory is used. Also called swap memory.In page table we keep a track of which page is present in RAM.
Demand Paging- We bring pages only when it is needed.

Page Hit/ Page Fault.
TLB- Cache of page-table (Traslation lookaside buffer)

SRAM - cache - uses flip-flop 
DRAM - RAM - uses capacitor

Page Replacement Algorithm - LRU

Thrashing- Too much page fault.
