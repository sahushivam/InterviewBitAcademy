Bit Manipulation
	
	1- only one element comes onces and rest comes thrice.

	Approach- Make array of size 64 and for each number and bit do increment, after that take modulo 3.

	Hamming distance is number of position where bits differ

	2- Find sum of hamming distance for all pairs.

		arr0[i] represent number of zeroes at ith bit in the array

		make array of size 64, count number of bits and then 

		i=0 to 64
			ans+=arr0[i]*(n-arr0[i])*2; ((i,j) is different than (j,i))

	3- Minimum XOR pair in the array
		Proof- Sorting and taking xor of consecutive element

	4- Max Xor pair in the array
		Approach 1- Using tries

		Approach 2- Using masking(IMPORTANT)


	4- Given L,R where L<R, find two integer a,b such that a^b is maximum
		find the leftmost bit that is toggled in L and R let it be at position x then, and ans will be pow(2,x)
